# Calculate total FOI between [now] and [now + d]: 



# we need: 
# 	- a function that quickly integrates over a FOI kernel, given start time. Ideally we can calculate this integral ahead of time - the cumulatve FOI, so we're just subtracting two numbers. 
# The function should map
#  the time since infection 
#  the person ID 
#  to a total infectiousness over a given period, which should add together (once properly normalized, I think by the population size)
#
